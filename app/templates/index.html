                                We claim to not access <strong>other user's data</strong>, which is normally used by the traditional recommendation algorithms. Traditional algorithms use <strong>collaborative filtering</strong>, which heavily relies on other user's data. We ask users to log in using Spotify so that we can compare the <strong>wave characteristics</strong> of their preferred Spotify songs and make unsupervised recommendations from our library. Users can choose to get recommendations based on "Top 20 Spotify Songs", "Saved Songs", "Recently Played Songs in 24 hours", or any of the playlists. This concept even works without getting preferences through Spotify. In that case, users would have to manually enter their preferred songs which is highly inconvenient.

                                Traditional algorithms use a popular <strong>collaborative filtering</strong> algorithm which finds other users with similar music taste as yours and make recommendations from their library which you might not have heard before. In our case, we have compiled a huge library of Spotify songs and trained an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on <strong>implicit sound wave characteristics</strong>. Once we get your preferences from Spotify, our algorithm will select an appropriate cluster for your song based on the wave characteristics. We will pick the closest song from the determined cluster and recommend it to you. As a result, we will only use your preferences and clusters generated from our library to make recommendations. We will not use other user's data.

                                We believe that the users usually love songs with similar sound wave characteristics like <strong>pitch, tempo, beats, frequency, timbre, acousticness, speechiness, etc.</strong>. While traditional algorithms assume that two or more users with similar taste on a few songs will like all the songs in common, we have a different perspective. Sometimes it's possible that if two or more users have same taste for a specific song, it's not necessary that they might have same taste for other songs. At times, the user might only like a specific song due to biases like favorite artists, albums, or even the actors. Instead, we believe that the users will like the songs which have similar implicit sound wave characteristics to their previously liked songs. Peek into your playlist and think if most of your songs have similar tempo, beats, frequency, genre, etc. As we recommend songs based on such characteristics, our algorithm is extremely reliable.

                                The traditional algorithms heavily rely on other user's data and it's dangerous to assume that we would always have access to other user's data. Also, due to stricter data privacy legislations, accessing user data for Internet-based services is becoming more and more difficult. Primarily motivated by this issue, our algorithm strictly uses the implicit sound wave characteristics of your previously liked or preferred songs and make ML-based recommendations from our libary.

                              If we were to use this algorithm in production, we could have trained it on an extremely huge library of songs. For example, Spotify has ~50 million songs. However, as we didn't have enough resources to handle such a huge amount of data, we trained a demo algorithm using 170,000 Spotify songs which are randomly compiled from 1938-2020. Because of random compilation, you might see some irrelevant recommendations. However, we believe that the algorithm could do better if trained on larger data.

                              As we didn't have access to <strong>labelled data</strong> from <strong>other users</strong>, we have used <strong>unsupervised machine learning algorithm</strong>. We primarily used <strong>K-Means Clustering</strong> & <strong>mini-batch K-Means Clustering</strong> to classify 170,000 songs in our library into 1000 clusters. As each of our songs had 9 features (sound wave characteristics), which was a lot for effective K-Means clustering, we used <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> for dimensionality reduction while preserving the sound wave characteristics. After evaluating the model performance using multiple hyperparameters (PCA-dimensions, number of clusters, etc.), we settled with 2 features and 1000 clusters. We used metrics like <strong>Sum of Squared Error (SSE) Score</strong> and <strong>Silhouette Score</strong> to determine the appropriate hyperparameters. In the current demo, we are using a <strong>K-Means Clustering</strong> algorithm trained for <strong>1000 clusters</strong>. Each song has <strong>2 features</strong> after the application of PCA.

                              This project can be expanded upon and the results can be drastically improved using one of the following methods:
                              <ul>
                                <li>Currently we only have 170,000 songs in our library. We can further improve the results if the model is trained with more songs.</li>
                                <li>Currently, no filters are applied to the recommendations made by ML algorithm. We can apply filters like year of release, language, genre, etc. to make the recommendations more relevant.</li>
                                <li>We are already collecting user approval data. Once we have enough data, we can retrain the ML algorithm with labelled data and a supervised approach to further improve the results.</li>
                                <li>K-Means Clustering algorithm is just a starting point for this problem. We can explore more algorithms (probably time-series based clustering) and hyperparameters to get even better results.</li>
                                <li>We can include more features (sound wave characteristics) and perform time-series based clustering to improve the results. This is a great direction for further exploration.</li>

                              <p>GPT-3 is a latest transformer-based model trained by OpenAI on a massive amount of data. GPT-3 can be trained to perform a wide-range of tasks by just training it using a few examples (few-shot learning). Which means, the GPT-3 API can be readily used to give a few training examples and results. The people who have an access to this API have done really cool projects like text to code, text to LaTex, etc. by training the GPT-3 model using a few manually generated examples.</p>
                              <p>Unfortunately, as the API is in early stages of development, only a few people have an access to this API and can use it for their own purpose. If we had an access to this API, we could have used it for making recommendations instead of K-Means Clustering. But that would have definitely made our project a lot less challenging because we would have only configured the API instead of manually compiling the data, engineering the features, trying out different hyperparameters, training a model, and deploying it in our application.</p>
