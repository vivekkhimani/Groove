1) Determine the best clustering hyperparams and generate the saved tally and sklearn model.

2) Write a script for generating PCA visualizations using the saved model and tally.

3) Plug in the inference script on the server code.

4) Modify the home.html to trigger appropriate endpoints and restructure the data as per the needs.

2) Also, desperately need to change the user interface
